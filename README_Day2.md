Solutions to Advent of Code


DAY 2
Steps to help understand
1. I used find and replace in text edit to add space between each character in the input file. 
2. Pasted the new input file into Excel. Used the import functionality to put each in its own cell.
3. Created named ranges in Sheet2 to act as the lookups
4. Used VLOOKUP to find the correct next value.  For part one the named reference is "a_12_2_Lookup_a" and part two the named reference is "a_12_2_b"
5. Used nested IF to determine which VLookup value
6. Drag copied rows to the end. Manually found final value.
